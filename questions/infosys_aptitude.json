                "150 metres"
            ],
            "answer": "150 metres",
            "explanation": "Speed = 60 km/hr = 60 × (5/18) = 50/3 m/s. Distance = Speed × Time = (50/3) × 9 = 150 m."

            ],
            "answer": "50 km/hr",
            "explanation": "Relative speed = Distance / Time = 125 / 10 = 12.5 m/s = 45 km/hr. If man runs at 5 km/hr, train speed = 45 + 5 = 50 km/hr."

            "answer": "245 m",
            "explanation": "Speed = 45 km/hr = 45 × (5/18) = 12.5 m/s. Distance covered in 30 sec = 12.5 × 30 = 375 m. Bridge length = 375 − 130 = 245 m."

            ],
            "answer": "3 : 2",
            "explanation": "Let speeds be a and b. Train lengths are proportional to times taken to cross the man: L1∝27, L2∝17. When crossing each other: (L1+L2)/(a+b)=23. Solving gives a:b = 3:2."

            "explanation": "Speed = 54 km/hr = 15 m/s. Train length = 15 × 20 = 300 m. Train + platform length = 15 × 36 = 540 m. Platform length = 540 − 300 = 240 m."
